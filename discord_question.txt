Subject: Help with `native_db::ToInput` trait implementation for types from a separate crate in a Rust workspace

Hey everyone,

I'm working on a Rust project (`yomichan_rs`) that's part of a larger workspace. One of its dependencies is another crate called `importer`.

I'm encountering an issue where types from the `importer` crate (e.g., `importer::dictionary_database::DatabaseTermEntryTuple`, `importer::dictionary_importer::DictionarySummary`) need to be inserted into a `native_db` database. However, `native_db` requires these types to implement the `native_db::ToInput` trait, which they currently do not.

The problem is that I cannot directly modify the `importer` crate's source code from my current working environment (the `yomichan_rs` project directory). The `importer` crate is located outside of my current project's root.

Here's a simplified view of the relevant code:

**`yomichan_rs/src/database/dictionary_importer.rs` (where the error occurs):**
```rust
// ...
use importer::DatabaseDictionaryData; // DatabaseDictionaryData contains types like term_list, kanji_list, summary
// ...

pub fn import_dictionary<P: AsRef<Path>>(
    zip_path: P,
    db: Arc<DictionaryDatabase>,
    current_profile: Ptr<YomichanProfile>,
) -> Result<DictionaryOptions, ImportError> {
    let data: DatabaseDictionaryData = prepare_dictionary(zip_path)?;
    let rwtx = db.rw_transaction()?;

    // These lines cause errors because data.term_list (Vec<importer::...DatabaseTermEntryTuple>)
    // and other lists do not implement native_db::ToInput
    db_rwriter(&rwtx, data.term_list)?;
    db_rwriter(&rwtx, data.kanji_list)?;
    db_rwriter(&rwtx, data.tag_list)?;
    db_rwriter(&rwtx, data.kanji_meta_list)?;
    db_rwriter(&rwtx, vec![data.summary])?; // data.summary (importer::...DictionarySummary) also doesn't implement ToInput

    rwtx.commit()?;
    Ok(data.summary.yomichan_options)
}

fn db_rwriter<L: native_db::ToInput>( // Requires L to implement ToInput
    rwtx: &native_db::transaction::RwTransaction,
    list: Vec<L>,
) -> Result<(), Box<native_db::db_type::Error>> {
    for item in list {
        rwtx.insert(item)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**The core issue:** How can I make types from the `importer` crate implement `native_db::ToInput` within the `yomichan_rs` project, given that I cannot directly modify the `importer` crate's source code?

**Things I've considered/ruled out (for now):**
*   **Directly modifying `importer` crate:** Not possible due to environment constraints.
*   **Serializing to JSON/bytes:** This would work, but it's a significant architectural change (schema change, no direct querying) that I'd like to avoid if there's a cleaner solution.

Is there a common Rust pattern or a `native_db` specific feature that allows for implementing traits for types from external crates without modifying the external crate itself, especially in a workspace setup? Perhaps some form of newtype pattern with blanket implementations, or a way to "re-export" and derive the trait?

Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
